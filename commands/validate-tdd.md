# Validate TDD Compliance

## Overview

Validate that your project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices correctly.

## Usage

```bash
npm run validate:tdd
```

## What This Validates

### 1. TDD Workflow Compliance
- Tests exist before implementation
- Test coverage meets requirements (90%+)
- Tests are meaningful and not just placeholders

### 2. Test Quality Standards
- Test names clearly describe behavior
- Tests are independent and isolated
- Tests cover edge cases and error conditions
- Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### 3. Implementation Standards
- Code is testable and well-structured
- No implementation without corresponding tests
- Error handling is properly tested
- Business logic is thoroughly covered

### 4. TDD Anti-pattern Detection
- Implementation written before tests
- Tests that don't validate behavior
- Tests that are too implementation-specific
- Missing test coverage for critical paths

## Validation Process

1. **Scan Project Structure**: Identify source files and test files
2. **Check Test Coverage**: Verify coverage meets 90%+ requirement
3. **Analyze Test Quality**: Review test structure and naming
4. **Validate TDD Workflow**: Check for proper test-first approach
5. **Generate Report**: Provide detailed feedback and recommendations

## Expected Output

```
TDD Validation Report
====================

✅ Test Coverage: 92% (meets 90% requirement)
✅ Test Structure: Proper AAA pattern used
✅ Test Naming: Clear and descriptive
✅ TDD Workflow: Tests written before implementation
⚠️  Edge Case Coverage: Some error conditions need more testing

Recommendations:
- Add tests for network error scenarios in UserService
- Improve validation error testing in FormComponent
- Consider adding integration tests for user workflow

Overall Status: TDD COMPLIANT ✅
```

## Manual TDD Checklist

Use this checklist during development to ensure TDD compliance:

- [ ] **Red Phase**: Write failing test that describes desired behavior
- [ ] **Green Phase**: Write minimal implementation to pass test
- [ ] **Refactor Phase**: Improve code while keeping tests green
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Maintain 90%+ coverage
- [ ] **Test Quality**: Tests are meaningful and maintainable
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases tested
- [ ] **Test Names**: Clear, descriptive test names
- [ ] **Test Isolation**: Tests don't depend on each other

## Common TDD Violations

### ❌ Writing Implementation First
```typescript
// WRONG: Implementation without tests
class UserService {
  async createUser(data: any) {
    return await database.users.create(data);
  }
}
```

### ❌ Poor Test Quality
```typescript
// WRONG: Vague, meaningless tests
it('should work', () => {
  expect(new UserService()).toBeDefined();
});
```

### ❌ Testing Implementation Details
```typescript
// WRONG: Testing how it works, not what it does
it('should call database.create once', () => {
  expect(mockDatabase.create).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

## TDD Best Practices

### ✅ Write Tests First
```typescript
// CORRECT: Test describes behavior
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should create user with generated ID', async () => {
    const result = await userService.createUser(validData);
    expect(result).toHaveProperty('id');
    expect(typeof result.id).toBe('string');
  });
});
```

### ✅ Test Behavior, Not Implementation
```typescript
// CORRECT: Test what it does, not how
it('should create user successfully', async () => {
  const result = await userService.createUser(validData);
  expect(result.name).toBe(validData.name);
  expect(result.email).toBe(validData.email);
});
```

## Next Steps

After running TDD validation:

1. **Review Report**: Understand any issues found
2. **Fix Violations**: Address TDD compliance issues
3. **Improve Tests**: Enhance test quality and coverage
4. **Establish Workflow**: Make TDD part of daily development
5. **Regular Validation**: Run validation regularly to maintain compliance

## Integration with CI/CD

Add TDD validation to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/tdd-validation.yml
name: TDD Validation
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  tdd-validation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run validate:tdd
      - run: npm run test:coverage
```

This ensures TDD compliance is checked on every code change.
