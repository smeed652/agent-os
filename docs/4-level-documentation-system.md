## Overview

Agent-OS implements a comprehensive 4-level documentation system that provides a complete hierarchy from strategic vision down to technical implementation. This system follows industry best practices and ensures traceability between all levels of documentation.

### Level 3: Product (2K Feet View)

**Purpose**: Define product requirements, user experience, and business logic
**Location**: `.agent-os/product/`
**Documents**:

- **PRDs**: Product Requirements Documents
- **User Stories**: User requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Product Roadmaps**: Feature planning and timelines
- **Implementation Plans**: Product development strategies

**Instructions**:

- `@create-prd.md` - Create Product Requirements Documents
- `@create-user-stories.md` - Define user stories
- `@create-product-roadmap.md` - Create product roadmaps

### Level 4: Specifications (Ground Level)

**Purpose**: Define technical implementation details and development tasks
**Location**: `.agent-os/specs/` and `.agent-os/project-specs/`
**Documents**:

- **Technical Specs**: Detailed technical specifications
- **API Specs**: API design and documentation
- **Database Schemas**: Data model definitions
- **Implementation Tasks**: Development task breakdowns

**Instructions**:

- `@create-spec.md` - Create technical specifications
- `@create-api-spec.md` - Define API specifications
- `@create-database-schema.md` - Design database schemas

## Document Relationships and Traceability

### Strategic → Architecture

- Vision documents inform architectural decisions
- Strategic objectives drive technology choices
- Strategic constraints influence architectural patterns

### Architecture → Product

- ADRs guide product requirements
- Technical constraints shape product features
- Architecture patterns influence user experience

### Product → Specifications

- PRDs drive technical specifications
- User stories become implementation tasks
- Product roadmaps inform development timelines

### Cross-Level Integration

- All documents include traceability links
- Status tracking across all levels
- Automated cross-referencing system
