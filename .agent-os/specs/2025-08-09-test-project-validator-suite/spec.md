# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Test Project Validator Suite
> Created: 2025-08-09
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create a comprehensive test project that serves as a validation environment for the Agent OS validator suite and workflow. This project will be a simple Hello World application that demonstrates all aspects of Agent OS integration, allowing us to test our 6 validators, workflow processes, and teardown/rebuild capabilities in a real-world scenario.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Validator System Testing

As a developer, I want to create a test project that validates our entire Agent OS validator suite, so that I can ensure all 6 validators work correctly against a real codebase and identify any integration issues.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Create a simple Node.js Hello World application with intentional quality variations
2. Initialize the project with Agent OS structure (.agent-os directory, product files)
3. Run all 6 validators (Code Quality, Spec Adherence, Security, Branch Strategy, Testing, Documentation)
4. Verify each validator produces expected results and catches intended issues
5. Demonstrate the complete Agent OS workflow from analyze-product to implementation

### Story 2: Teardown and Rebuild Capability

As a tester, I want the ability to completely tear down and rebuild the test project, so that I can run clean validation tests repeatedly and ensure our setup process is robust and repeatable.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Create automated scripts to completely remove the test project
2. Create automated scripts to rebuild the test project from scratch
3. Ensure the rebuild process follows the exact same Agent OS initialization workflow
4. Verify that rebuilt projects produce identical validation results
5. Test multiple teardown/rebuild cycles to ensure reliability

### Story 3: Agent OS Workflow Validation

As an Agent OS user, I want to validate the complete workflow from product analysis to spec implementation, so that I can ensure our instruction files and processes work correctly in a real project environment.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Test @analyze-product.md against the test project
2. Test @create-spec.md workflow for creating new features
3. Test @implement-spec.md workflow for feature implementation
4. Validate lifecycle management (planning, active, completed states)
5. Test dashboard generation and status tracking
6. Ensure all Agent OS commands work correctly with the test project

## Spec Scope

1. **Test Project Creation** - Build a simple Node.js Hello World app with deliberate quality variations for validator testing
2. **Agent OS Integration** - Full .agent-os directory structure with product files, specs, and lifecycle management
3. **Validator Test Suite** - Comprehensive testing of all 6 validators against the test project codebase
4. **Teardown/Rebuild Scripts** - Automated scripts for complete project removal and recreation
5. **Workflow Validation** - Testing of all Agent OS instruction files and commands against the test project

## Out of Scope

- Complex application features beyond Hello World functionality
- Production deployment or hosting considerations
- Performance optimization beyond basic validation
- Integration with external services or databases
- Advanced CI/CD pipeline setup beyond basic validation

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Test Project** - A working Node.js Hello World application that can be built, run, and tested
2. **Complete Validator Coverage** - All 6 validators successfully run against the project with expected results
3. **Agent OS Workflow Validation** - All Agent OS commands and processes work correctly with the test project
4. **Teardown/Rebuild Automation** - Scripts that can completely remove and recreate the test project reliably
5. **Documentation and Results** - Clear documentation of validation results and any issues discovered in the Agent OS system
