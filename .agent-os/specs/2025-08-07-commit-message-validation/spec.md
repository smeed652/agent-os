# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Commit Message Validation System
> Created: 2025-08-07
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive commit message validation system using Husky hooks to prevent conventional commit format violations and reduce development cycle rework. This system will enforce consistent commit standards across the team and integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines.

## User Stories

### Developer Efficiency

As a developer, I want my commit messages to be automatically validated before pushing, so that I can catch format issues early and avoid the rework cycle of fixing commits and redoing the entire development process.

### Team Consistency

As a team lead, I want all team members to follow the same commit message standards, so that our changelog generation works correctly and our git history remains clean and professional.

### CI/CD Integration

As a DevOps engineer, I want commit message validation to be enforced in our CI/CD pipeline, so that we can catch any issues that bypass local hooks and maintain code quality standards.

## Spec Scope

1. **Husky Git Hooks** - Implement commit-msg hook to validate conventional commit format
2. **Commitizen Integration** - Add interactive commit message creation with prompts
3. **CI/CD Validation** - Add commit message validation to pipeline with clear error messages
4. **Documentation Updates** - Enhance best practices with detailed commit guidelines
5. **Automated Fixing Tools** - Create scripts to fix common commit message issues

## Out of Scope

- Changing existing commit message format standards
- Modifying the conventional commit specification
- Adding new commit types beyond the existing set
- Implementing commit message templates for specific projects
- Adding commit message length restrictions beyond conventional commit standards

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working Husky Hooks** - commit-msg hook that validates and rejects invalid commits
2. **Commitizen Setup** - Interactive commit creation with proper conventional commit prompts
3. **CI/CD Integration** - Pipeline validation that blocks merges with invalid commits
4. **Enhanced Documentation** - Updated best practices with commit message guidelines
5. **Recovery Tools** - Scripts to fix common commit message formatting issues
