## Overview

Implement secure user authentication system that allows users to register, login, and manage their accounts with email verification and password security features.

## User Stories

### User Registration
As a new user, I want to create an account with email and password, so that I can access the application's features.

The user will navigate to the registration page, enter their email address, create a password that meets security requirements, and receive a confirmation email to verify their account before gaining full access.

### User Login
As a registered user, I want to log into my account securely, so that I can access my personalized content and features.

Users will enter their credentials on the login page, with the system validating their information and providing appropriate error messages for invalid attempts while maintaining security best practices.
