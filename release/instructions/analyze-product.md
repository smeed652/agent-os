# Product Analysis Rules

## Backwards Compatibility Notice

This file has been moved to maintain better organization. The actual product analysis logic is now located at:

**New Location**: `@~/.agent-os/instructions/core/analyze-product.md`

## Automatic Redirect

For backwards compatibility, this wrapper automatically redirects to the new location:

**EXECUTE**: `@~/.agent-os/instructions/core/analyze-product.md`

---

_This wrapper ensures that existing projects using `@~/.agent-os/instructions/analyze-product.md` continue to work without modification._
