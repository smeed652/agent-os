# Create ADR (Wrapper)

This file is a backwards compatibility wrapper. The main `create-adr.md` instruction has been moved to a new, more organized location:

**New Location**: `@~/.agent-os/instructions/core/create-adr.md`

Please update your references to the new path for direct access to the latest features and improvements.

**EXECUTE**: `@~/.agent-os/instructions/core/create-adr.md`

_This wrapper ensures that existing projects using `@~/.agent-os/instructions/create-adr.md` continue to work without modification._
