# Pre-Flight Rules

- IMPORTANT: Subagent references (subagent="context-fetcher", subagent="file-creator", etc.) are conceptual workflow steps. Execute the step instructions directly without looking for actual subagent tools.

- Process XML blocks sequentially

- Use exact templates as provided

- Product directory (`.agent-os/product/`) is optional - Agent OS works with or without it
