## Overview

Create a comprehensive Node.js application builder that generates complete development environments with testing, validation, security, and deployment capabilities. This tool will serve as a foundation for rapid application development with enterprise-grade quality assurance and automated CI/CD workflows.

## User Stories

### Developer Productivity Story

As a **developer**, I want to **quickly bootstrap a complete Node.js application environment**, so that **I can focus on business logic rather than setup and configuration**.

The system should generate a fully configured Node.js application with Express.js, comprehensive testing suites (unit, integration, performance, security), automated validation scripts, build processes, and deployment-ready configurations. The generated application should include middleware, utilities, configuration management, and documentation templates.

### Quality Assurance Story

As a **development team lead**, I want to **ensure consistent code quality and testing standards across all projects**, so that **we maintain high reliability and reduce technical debt**.

The builder should implement comprehensive testing frameworks, automated code quality checks, security validation, performance monitoring, and standardized development processes that enforce best practices and catch issues early in the development cycle.

### Deployment Automation Story

As a **DevOps engineer**, I want to **have standardized build and deployment processes**, so that **applications can be reliably deployed across different environments**.

The system should generate build scripts, validation workflows, release management tools, and deployment configurations that ensure consistent, reliable application delivery with proper error handling and rollback capabilities.

## Spec Scope

1. **Application Structure Generation** - Create complete Node.js/Express.js application with organized directory structure, configuration files, and entry points
2. **Testing Framework Integration** - Implement Jest testing with unit, integration, performance, and security test suites with coverage reporting
3. **Build and Validation Scripts** - Generate automated build processes, code quality validation, and pre-deployment checks
4. **Development Workflow Tools** - Create development scripts for reset, rebuild, and validation with comprehensive error handling
5. **Documentation Generation** - Produce complete documentation including README, API docs, development guides, and deployment instructions

## Out of Scope

- Frontend framework integration (React/Vue/Angular)
- Database schema generation and migration tools
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Third-party service integrations (payment, email, etc.)
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes/Docker Swarm)
- Multi-language support beyond Node.js

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Application Generator** - Command-line tool that creates a complete, runnable Node.js application with all specified features
2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - Generated applications include 70%+ test coverage with all test types (unit, integration, performance, security)
3. **Production-Ready Build Process** - Applications include validated build scripts, deployment configurations, and quality assurance workflows that pass all validation checks
