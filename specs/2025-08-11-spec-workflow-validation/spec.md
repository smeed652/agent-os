## Overview

Validate the complete spec creation workflow to ensure all files are generated correctly with proper templates and formatting.

## User Stories

### Workflow Validation Testing

As a developer, I want to test the spec creation process, so that I can verify all components work correctly.

This involves running the @create-spec.md command and verifying that all expected files are created with the correct content structure, proper Agent-OS headers, and appropriate cross-references between files.

## Spec Scope

1. **Spec File Generation** - Verify spec.md is created with correct template structure
2. **Lite Summary Creation** - Ensure spec-lite.md contains proper summary content
3. **Technical Specification** - Generate technical-spec.md with implementation details
4. **Task Breakdown** - Create tasks.md with TDD approach and proper numbering
5. **Status Tracking** - Generate status.md for lifecycle management

## Out of Scope

- Actual implementation of features
- Integration with external systems
- Performance optimization testing

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete set of spec files generated in correct directory structure
2. All files contain proper Agent-OS v2.2.1 headers and formatting
3. Cross-references between files work correctly
