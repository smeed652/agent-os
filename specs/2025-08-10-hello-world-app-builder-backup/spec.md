> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create a repeatable, automated development process for building a Hello World application that can be reset, rebuilt, and tested repeatedly to validate our development workflow and ensure consistent quality.

## User Stories

### Repeatable Development Process

As a **Developer**, I want to **have a standardized process for building Hello World apps**, so that **I can validate our development workflow repeatedly and ensure consistency**.

### Automated Testing Integration

As a **Developer**, I want to **integrate comprehensive testing into the build process**, so that **I can catch issues early and maintain code quality**.

### Process Validation

As a **Developer**, I want to **be able to reset and rebuild the app multiple times**, so that **I can verify our development process is robust and repeatable**.

## Spec Scope

1. **Project Setup** - Automated project initialization with proper directory structure and dependencies
2. **Core Application** - Simple Express.js Hello World server with configurable endpoints
3. **Testing Framework** - Comprehensive test suite covering functionality, security, and performance
4. **Build Automation** - Scripts for building, testing, and deploying the application
5. **Reset Capability** - Ability to completely reset the project and start fresh
6. **Documentation** - Complete documentation for the development process
7. **Validation Scripts** - Tools to validate the entire development workflow

## Out of Scope

- Complex application features beyond Hello World functionality
- Production deployment configurations
- Advanced security features beyond basic validation
- Performance optimization beyond basic requirements

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working Hello World Application** - Functional Express.js server with Hello World endpoints
2. **Complete Test Suite** - Tests covering all aspects of the application
3. **Build Scripts** - Automated scripts for setup, testing, and reset
4. **Process Documentation** - Step-by-step guide for the development process
5. **Validation Framework** - Tools to verify the entire process works correctly
6. **Reset Mechanism** - Ability to completely reset and rebuild from scratch
